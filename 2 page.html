		There are different levels in fighting games in terms of skill but since you are the beginner, it's appropriate to recommend most of the beginner friendly games. The first one that comes to mind is Super Smash Bros Ultimate which is a platform fighter instead of a traditional fighting game. This game features the biggest fighting game character roster of any fighting game, so you have a lot of choices as to who you want to play as. As for the gameplay itself, it has very simple commands and inputs, so the learning curve is easy.

		However, there is another Super Smash Bros game called, "Super Smash Bros Melee". It's the second game in the series that is considered to be the most technical platform fighter. This is recommended for those who feel more of a mechanical challenge after trying Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

		When you feel like you are ready for something more than platform fighters like the ones stated previously or you just want to go straight to traditional fighting games, a good place to start is Dragonball Fighterz. This is a team based game where you play three characters at once, so there needs to be some team synergy if needed. The reason why this is a good start is because the commands while not as simple as Super Smash Bros games, they can be comprehended enough to not take so long to learn. This game also has its own fanservice for those who love the series of Dragonball or anime in general.

		If you want harder team based gameplay, Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 will do the job for you. It has a similar gameplay format as Dragonball Fighterz, but it has more commands that are not as simple. Much like Dragonball Fighterz however, it is full of fanservice for both Marvel comics fans and Capcom fans. All the characters are very unique and are fun to play.

		Other games that I would recommend are Guilty Gear Strive which is beginner friendly, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 which has lots of complexity compared to Guilty Gear Strive, Mortal Kombat 9, Mortal Kombat 11, Street Fighter 4, and Marvel Vs Capcom 2 which is a classic and is considered to be one of if not the best fighting game ever made. There are two fighting games that are free to play. One of which is Multiversus which is available on all platforms except for Nintendo Switch, and the second free to play fighting game is Brawlhalla which is the most simple of all fighting games that is avaible for all platforms. There is also a fangame that is free to down on your browser that can even be played on Macbook called Super Smash Flash 2.
